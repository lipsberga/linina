The question whether to use or not to use authentic materials in English for specific purpose course is more topical than ever. More and more people are studying new languages every day and as English is the international language, researchers are especially interested to find out the advantages and disadvantages of using authentic materials in English teaching classes. As nowadays knowing a foreign language can be very beneficial not only in the job market, but also in real life situations, many people are trying to find ways how to study a language in a more efficient and exciting way. 
	Language is a huge part of our lives and as Norman Fairclough suggests “language is part of society; linguistic phenomena are social phenomena of a special sort, and social phenomena are linguistic phenomena” (2001:19) Language provides people not only with knowledge and information, but also communication. Language is not only words and sentences but also culture and history. For students to fully understand a foreign language, they have to hear the real-life language that one can hear on the streets, in the office, bus or read in the magazines and brochures.  Rogers and Medley suggests to ‘bring authentic materials into the classroom and make them consistently accessible to the students’ (1988: 475). For students to hear the real-life language, can be very motivating, because sitting in a class and hearing only the teacher or reading text books can become very tiresome. Nuttall claims that ‘authentic texts can be motivating because they are proof that the language is used for real-life purposes by real people. (1996: 172) When a student hears and understands a real life conversation, it can become a huge motivation to continue to study the language and become better at it. 
It is good to start with grammatically correct language so that the students learn how to write and speak correctly. That is why it is very time-consuming to find appropriate authentic materials that can be used in the class. Widdowson claims that exposing learners to authentic materials is indispensable because of the rich language input they provide. (1990: 162) Language in a regular textbooks can be very different from language in articles, newspapers and work documents and that is why incorporating authentic materials is very beneficial. Authors claim that the textbooks are very ‘far away from that real, informal kind of English which is used very much more than any other during a normal speaking lifetime’ (Crystal, Davy 1975: 2)

Latvia is a very small country with its own language and that is why for Latvian citizens being fluent in more than one language is a must to be successful in finding a good job or developing a career. One of the most taught and spoken language not only in Latvia but also in the world is English. (Kachru, Nelson, 2001: 9) There are many foreign firms in Latvia and that is why English has become the main office language in many companies. Furthermore, ‘foreign languages are becoming the intellectual tool for the development of intercultural competence, in the sense of declarative knowledge and communication skills’ (Balič, 2009: 1).
This paper focuses only on English for Specific Purposes(ESP) where the main purpose is to study English specifically for an activity or job. Harding suggests that in ESP ‘the practical application and use of language overrides other aspects of language learning.’ (Harding, 2007: 7) There has been many studies done about authentic material use between students in different universities and schools, but none are done about students that already have a real job and experience with using the language at work. These are especially part-time students and master-degree students. Most of the part-time students already work a full-time job and have the experience of working in a company and using the language and the same goes for the post-graduate students that study in the evening after work. Some even have already finished education in other field or university and therefore have both – the practical and theoretical knowledge. While studying a subject, they can relate and compare the theory that is studied at the university with the real-life experience they have had and that is a huge benefit.
As the time at the university is very limited for part-time students or students that go to the university in the evenings after work, it could be more useful to focus only on the theory and not so much on using authentic materials, because part-time and post-graduate students already have that real-life experience outside the university. Therefore, the goal of this research is to find out the opinions and usefulness of authentic materials in ESP for students who already have job experience. 
In order to understand that, the following research questions were addressed:
Do students with real work experience think that authentic materials should be used in the classroom while studying English?
What are the reasons for using/not using authentic materials while studying English?
Do students with real work experience think that the use of authentic materials in the classroom have helped them to succeed in their jobs?
The following enabling objectives are set:
1) To read and analyze the theory available on authentic materials;
2) To make and afterwards analyze the questionnaires;
3) To draw relevant conclusions.

For this research, literature review and surveys are used as research methods. Book by Tina Balič (2009) Using Authentic Materials in Teaching English as a Foreign Language is used as the main theoretical framework in order to adapt authentic texts to match the language level of students. 
Visidati.lv was used to make surveys and collect information and opinions about the usefulness of authentic materials between students that already have a real job experience. 















1 AUTHENTIC MATERIALS

The use of authentic materials has a very long history. Many researches and theories have been developed during the 20th century. Such authors as Chomsky (1965) and Hymes (1972)  have been discussing and debating whether to use or not to use authentic materials. Henry Sweet used authentic materials in his books very often and believed that there are many advantages of using authentic materials while teaching and studying a foreign language. 
The great advantage of natural, idiomatic texts over artificial ‘methods’ or ‘series’ is that they do justice to every feature of the language ... The artificial systems, on the other hand, tend to cause incessant repetition of certain grammatical constructions, certain elements of the vocabulary, certain combinations of words to the almost total exclusion of others which are equally, or perhaps even more, essential. (Sweet 1899: 177)
Over the years, the role of authentic materials and theories about authenticity has become very complex and can be researched from many perspectives. For instance, authenticity in discourse, second language studying, psychology, communication and even motivation research. Many authenticity definitions have been developed in order to better understand what is the meaning of authenticity. Porter and Roberts claim that it is ‘the language produced by native speakers for native speakers in a particular language community’ (1981:37) Kramsch has defined it as ‘culture, and the ability to behave or think like a target language group in order to be recognized and validated by them’ (Kramsch 1998). Morrow suggests that ‘an authentic text is a stretch of real language, produced by a real speaker or writer for a real audience and designed to convey a real message of some sort.’(1977: 13) 

More and more people decide to study a new language for a various reason. It is not an easy task for a teacher to find authentic materials that will help and motivate students to learn a new language and make the learning process as easy and enjoyable as possible. When choosing appropriate authentic materials, teachers should take into consideration many factors, such as, the age of students, their interests, needs, purpose of studies and level of language. There are many kinds of authentic materials to choose from- books, magazines, movies, theatre, posters, advertisements, audio tapes, computer-based programs, photographs, dramatizations, songs, anecdotes, travel brochures, menus, catalogues, real estate pamphlets, phone books, CDs and the internet. The authentic materials chosen should always be grammatically correct, because language learners pick up the new words and the structure of sentences very quickly. Exception would be if the task is to find a mistakes or a wrongly created sentences in the authentic materials, which is also a great way to learn and try something new. 



























2 THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF AUTHENTIC MATERIALS

2.1. The advantages of authentic materials

In today’s society, it is very important to know at least one foreign language. Knowing a foreign language opens many exciting doors. For instance, new job opportunities, travelling to new places, foreign language reading materials, foreign movies, meeting new people from different countries and learning about new cultures. The list goes on and the benefits are endless. Nowadays English teachers have many books, texts, materials to choose from. There is a wide variety of teaching materials and one of the most important tasks for the teacher is to make the study process as enjoyable as possible and therefore many teachers chose to use authentic materials in the classroom. 
Firstly, one of the advantages of using authentic materials is that they make the study process exciting. Peacock claims that they ‘bring pupils closer to the target language culture and this will result in making the teaching-learning process more enjoyable and useful and thus, motivating’. (Peacock, 1997: 144). Students always find video materials, magazines and radio conversations from real life exciting and interesting. 
Secondly, authentic materials can serve as a motivation to study the new language. For a student to realize that he/she understands a real-life conversation between people can be a huge revelation. Nuttall mentions that ‘authentic texts can be motivating because they are proof that the language is used for real-life purposes by real people’. (1996: 172) Sometimes students get discouraged and lost in the learning process because they do not see the progress or do not see the benefits of knowing a foreign language. Using authentic materials in the classroom is very beneficial as they are a way of maintaining or increasing students’ motivation for learning as they give the learner the feeling that they are in touch with a living entity and the target language as it is used in the community which speaks it’. (Guariento and Morley, 2001: 347)
Lastly, many scholars agree on the fact that ‘learners should be exposed to authentic text so that they may have direct contact with input data which reflects genuine communication in the target language’’ (Breen, 1985: 63) The problem with using only text books is that they do not show the real language. It is necessary for students to learn both – the formal and the informal language that one can hear in the office, store or cinema. ‘Mastering even a small degree of comprehension of authentic texts gives students the confidence in dealing with reading for real purposes’ (Richard, 2004) The more often authentic texts will be used in the classroom, the bigger the possibility that students will understand them better. 

2.2 THE DISADVANTAGES OF USING AUTHENTIC MATERIALS

Alongside with the many advantages of authentic materials, some disadvantages must be considered. The question whether authentic materials should be only used for post-intermediate and advanced levels is still topical. The opinions about using authentic materials in lower-level classes differ as there are a lot of cons to consider. For instance, the grammar structures. If the students are at advanced level in English, understanding the grammar should not be a problem in authentic materials, but for beginners, new and complex grammar structures may cause a confusion and devastation. 
As discussed in this research above, authentic materials can serve as a motivation for students to keep studying and expanding their English language knowledge, but, unfortunately, they also can discourage students. Many scholars, such as, Freeman and Holden (1986) William (1983) and Morrison (1989) have mentioned the risk that students might get discouraged because the texts are too complex and difficult to understand.  That is why teachers have to spend a lot of time in order to find the right level of authentic texts or edit the text so that they are adjusted to the student’s needs. For some teachers who are creative and edit the texts, this might be interesting, but for some it may be too time-consuming and therefore they choose not to use them at all.  
Richard has claimed in his book that authentic texts usually have unnecessary vocabulary items and complex language structures (2001:253) Usually authentic texts contain many new words for students and that is a great way to study. Together with a teacher, students can underline words in the authentic texts that will be useful in the future and learn them by heart, but unfortunately understanding which will be useful and which not may take a lot of time and some scholars consider this as a disadvantage because of the time-consuming categorization of words. 
In addition, some authentic texts may include some words that cannot be found in a dictionary or the information in the text can be out of date and that can cause many students to question the usefulness of the authentic texts. These texts sometimes can be biased and therefore can give a wrong impression of the culture they represent. Moreover, authentic texts can have culture and language references that even speakers that have English as mother-tongue language from other countries, or age groups would not comprehend. 
Taking into considerations both – the advantages and disadvantages, it is also important to look at students’ reactions and productivity at class. For example, a research carried out by Chavez (1998) showed that language learners really enjoy authentic material use in the class since they allow students to interact with the real language used by the native speakers of that language. Students seem to be more active and show enthusiasm when analysing or hearing authentic texts. They get more involved answering the questions asked by the teacher and seem generally interested in the authentic material tasks. When deciding to use or not use authentic materials, all the pros and cons should be considered. 

















3 USE OF AUTHENTIC MATERIALS 


3.1. Research methodology

The main research method of this paper is survey research and its main purpose is ‘to produce statistics, that is, quantitative and numerical descriptions about some aspects of the study population.’ (Floyd J., 2009:1) The author of the book Survey research methods also mentions that in surveys the information is collected about only ‘a fraction of the population, that is, a sample rather than from every member of population.’ (Floyd J., 2009:1) As the main task of this research is to find out opinions of students that have a job experience about using authentic materials for ESP, surveys are going to give an overview and information about that.
In this research, mainly qualitative research approach is used, because the main aim of this research is to find out students’ opinions about the usefulness of authentic materials for ESP. Jalal Monfared claims that
Qualitative research is primarily exploratory research. It is used to gain an
understanding of underlying reasons, opinions, and motivations. It provides insights
into the problem or helps to develop ideas or hypotheses for potential
quantitative research. (2015:1112)

In addition, in this research two different articles are analyzed and adapted so they match the language level of students. Difficult expressions and phrases will be replaced with easier words and grammar structures. 


In carrying out the present research, several research procedures were applied:
identifying research goal, research questions and enabling objectives; 
selecting a corpus; 
studying context;
doing analysis of the surveys.

3.2. The survey results
In order to find out opinions of people that already have work experience, different students and people that graduated from the university were surveyed.  The average age of respondents is 27 years. 20% of people are males, 80% females. Almost 23% of the students surveyed have already a finished degree in a different field, but the rest are currently studying to get a bachelor degree. Occupations of respondents are very different. For instance, IT administrator, country buyer, marketer, teacher, customer support consultant, flight attendant, model, photographer. Almost 80 % of people surveyed said that they use English on a daily basis at their workplace and this only shows the importance of learning English in order to succeed in finding a good job. 
 Firstly, a general question was asked whether respondents enjoy using authentic materials in the class. The results show in the table 3.1 that almost 86 % do enjoy and only 14% do not. 
Figure 3.1 Do you enjoy using authentic materials in the English classes? 

This question was asked in order to understand a general opinion of respondents about authentic materials and to explain what exactly authentic materials are as not everyone is familiar with the term. 
It is important that students do enjoy the class activities and are excited about learning, but it is just as important for the students to find the authentic materials useful. The chart below shows that 83 % of the respondents find the authentic materials useful in regards of learning a language. 
Figure 3.2 Usefulness of authentic materials

After finding out the opinions of students about usefulness of authentic materials, it was interesting to understand which type of authentic materials students enjoy the most. The results differ. In the chart 3.3 it is possible to say that students do enjoy video materials the most. This could be because video materials not only provide visual effects but also let students hear the real language and real life conversations.  In addition, non – verbal aspects of communication are presented in the videos which really helps to better understand the language. These are all the gestures, expressions, posture and even clothes that people wear. 
40 % of the respondents think that all the authentic materials mentioned are equally useful because each material has its own advantages. For instance, videos can provide students not only with hearing a real language, but also show the culture. Radio can teach students to listen carefully to the language and correct pronunciation of words. Articles can show the written language while providing students with some useful and new information.



Figure 3.3 Which type of authentic materials do you find the most useful?


Opinions differ in regards to necessity of authentic materials for people that already have a job and use English language daily at work. To the question whether part time students should focus more on theory and exclude authentic materials from the study process, more than half of the respondents disagreed and answered that authentic materials should be used as a part of the learning process. 45% answered that lectures should be more focussed on the theory because they use and hear English at work every day and it would be more useful to use this time studying, for instance, grammar, text analysis or legal English. 
However, in the chart below we can see that 75% of the respondents believe that authentic materials have helped them to succeed in finding a good job. From this we can conclude that people surveyed think that authentic materials in English for specific purposes classes is a very useful tool and should be part of the learning process, but only for full time students that do not have any work experience. For those that study after work or on Saturdays, more focus should be put on theory because time is so limited. 
As the main advantages for using authentic materials in the English classes students mention motivation. Authentic materials motivate students to continue study so that they can communicate with other people from other countries or get a better job. In addition, students mention that authentic materials make the study process more exciting and interesting which is very important. The regular English text books are necessary as well, but the language in them is very different form the real language that is used in the office, on the streets or anywhere else. 
Figure 3.4. Do you think that authentic material use in the class have helped you to succeed in your career? 













3.3. Easifying authentic ESP texts

Adapting authentic materials for English studying is quite time consuming and demanding task because a lot of factors must be taken into consideration, such as, the age of students, gender, the language level and students’ interests. There are different kinds of authentic materials, for instance, annual reports, newsletters, magazines, brochures, memos, minutes of meetings and contracts. In this research two different articles, an annual report will be analysed and adapted for English teaching classes using different methods. 
One of the most important factor is the level of language of the students. The authentic text must be edited so it matches the needs of the students. Difficult expressions or words should be replaced with something that is used more frequently. Semantic elements, lexical elements, punctuation, idioms and grammar should be adapted to the students’ language level accordingly. 
There are different techniques of easifying ESP texts, such as, adding translation, highlighting some important words or sentences, numbering lines, adding subheadings, visuals, comments or changing the size of letters. 
For this research, three different text are analysed and modified using different methods for easifying ESP texts. The first text (Table 1) analysed is an article taken from www.theguardian.com and is about learning a new language. Studying languages is very important because learning a new language may open door for an exciting job opportunity or chance to travel.  The second article (Table 2) is more complex as it contains different statistics about jobs and employment. Different expressions and phrases are used in this article to analyse the unemployment situation in the USA. The third text is a part of an annual report of Herbal life LTD. This text is edited using highlighting method and numbering lines. 





Text Nr. 3.

Examples of questions and tasks for students after reading the annual report.

What is the meaning of the word to enhance in the third line? Write a sentence using this word. 
To which word the pronoun their in the third line refers to ? 
What is the purpose of the Herbal life company? 
Make a table with two columns. In one column write out all the words that you do not know  column and translate them. In the other column write all the words that you think are useful and learn them by heart.  
Make a mind map for each paragraph and write out the key words. 
Discuss and compere with your classmate the unknown words and translate them to your language. 


After easying these 3 ESP texts using different methods, it can be concluded that the adaption of authentic materials for student needs is very time consuming. First of all, choosing the right kind of text or video materials from all the possible options. Second, reading through and modifyng difficult verbs or grammar. Lastly, the texts should be relevant and interesting so that students would like to read and learn from them. 










CONCLUSIONS


This paper has explained the benefits and disadvantages of using authentic materials for teaching English in the ESP classes. Scholars have very different opinions whether authentic materials should be used for teaching and that is why in this research both – advantages and disadvantages - were discussed. In addition, this paper researched the opinions of students, specifically students that have already work experience, about authentic material use in the classroom, but at the end of the day it is the teacher who has to decide the usefulness of authentic materials. 
Returning to the goal of this research posed in the beginning, it is now possible to state that people surveyed think that authentic materials in English for specific purposes classes is a very useful tool and should be part of the learning process, but only for full time students that do not have any work experience. For those that study after work or on Saturdays, more focus should be put on theory because time is so limited. As the biggest advantage students mention motivation and that authentic materials make the study process more fun and exciting. 
The most important limitation lies in the fact that students surveyed were all from University of Latvia - the faculty of humanities. As this is the language faculty, it made sense to survey students from this faculty. However, different results could be if respondents would be from different universities that also study English as the second language.
Further research might explore different types of authentic materials in the English classes. For instance, how students react to text materials and audio materials. Which do they prefer more and which do bring the most benefits. Another aspect could be analysing work related authentic materials and bring them into studying process. 






THESIS

Language is more than just words and sentences. It is the culture and history of people who speak it. 
In a basic sense, authentic materials are those that are originally produced by native speakers of that language and are used by first language speakers.
Authentic materials can give students an insight of how the language is used in real life situations. 
Authentic materials can serve as a great motivation in the learning process, because they can bring students closer to the target language culture. 
There are different kind of authentic materials, such as, brochures, videos, newspapers, books, company reviews, newsletters, movies and many more. 
The surveys show that students find authentic materials very helpful, motivating and interesting. 
Many different factors, such as age of students, gender, level of language, must be taken into consideration when choosing authentic materials for the class. 
Part-time students that are working full-time think that their classes should be more theory based because of the limited time they have with the teacher.
