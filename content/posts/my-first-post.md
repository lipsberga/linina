Artificial intelligence for learning a second language. 
INTRODUCTION

Nowadays knowing a second language is not only considered as norm but also as a necessity in order to be successful in the job market. Learning a new language has always been challenging and time consuming. It not only requires a lot of effort but also a great teacher, a couple of books and dictionaries. Nowadays with the modern technologies and multiple applications it seems to be easier to learn a new language, but is that really the case? The question whether it is easier to learn a new language nowadays is more topical than ever. More and more people are studying new languages every day. As nowadays knowing a foreign language can be very beneficial not only in the job market, but also in real life situations, many people are trying to find ways how to study a language in a more efficient and exciting way. 
	Language is a huge part of our lives and as Norman Fairclough suggests 'language is part of society; linguistic phenomena are social phenomena of a special sort, and social phenomena are linguistic phenomena' (2001:19) Language provides people not only with knowledge and information, but also communication. Language is not only words and sentences but also culture and history. For students to fully understand a foreign language, they have to hear the real-life language that one can hear on the streets, in the office, bus or read in the magazines and brochures. How to do that without moving to a different country? The answer might be - Artificial Intelligence. For students to hear the real-life language, can be very motivating, because sitting in a class and hearing only the teacher or reading text books can become very tiresome. Nuttall claims that ‘authentic texts can be motivating because they are proof that the language is used for real-life purposes by real people. (1996: 172) When a student hears and understands a real-life conversation, it can become a huge motivation to continue to study the language and become better at it. 
It is good to start with grammatically correct language so that the students learn how to write and speak correctly. That is why it is very time-consuming to find appropriate authentic materials that can be used in the class. Widdowson claims that exposing learners to authentic materials is indispensable because of the rich language input they provide. (1990: 162) Language in a regular textbook can be very different from language in articles, newspapers and work documents and that is why incorporating authentic materials is very beneficial. Authors claim that the textbooks are very ‘far away from that real, informal kind of English which is used very much more than any other during a normal speaking lifetime’ (Crystal, Davy 1975: 2) and because textbooks are so irrelevant, can Artificial Intelligence help people to learn language in a more exciting and more efficient way? 
In addition, there are not a lot of people that choose to study Latvian. Mostly, it is because it is not a widely used language, but also, because it is a rather difficult language. But how about those people who come to live in Latvia and never learn to speak Latvian? If there would be developed Al tools for learning Latvian language, would they learn it faster? The main goal of this paper is to find out whether or not foreigners would be more willing to learn Latvian if there would be appropriate Artificial intelligence tools for learning Latvian language.  A survey will be developed and given out to foreign people living in Latvia in order to find out the reason why they have not learned Latvian and whether or not it is because of the lack of materials, online tools and applications for learning Latvian. In case of lack of materials, artificial intelligence could help in this matter if new tools would be developed for learning a Latvian language. 
The following research questions were addressed:
1) What kind of Al tools are available right now for learning a new language?
2) Are there any tools available for learning Latvian language?
3) Would foreigners learn Latvian if appropriate Al tools would be developed?

To answer these research questions, the following enabling objectives are set:
1) To read and analyze the theory available on Al and language learning;
2) To analyze available research on Al effectiveness when learning a new language 
3) To make a survey about Al and Latvian language and give it to foreigners
4) To draw relevant conclusions.

In this paper, the opportunities that Artificial Intelligence brings, in regard to learning a new language will be also explored. Such Artificial Intelligence tools as, machine translation, personalized textbooks, chatbots and personalized teaching will be explored. It is also intended to research what Natural Language processing can bring into the language learning. Natural language processing are also used to help AI become a valuable tool for language learning. Natural language processing allows machines to read and understand human language; collocation extraction can be used to retrieve information, classify documents, and solve language generation problems.



















2 THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR LANGUAGE LEARNING PURPOSES
2.1 Artificial Intelligence for translation.
AI-based language translation projects, for example, Google Translate have made extraordinary progress in supporting second language and foreign students for a huge scope. Google Translate underpins more than 100 languages at different levels, and as of May 2017 serves more than 500 million individuals every day. Given the universal accessibility of this translation service, second language students are taking advantage of it to enlarge their learning past the classroom. Machine translation from Google, which uses statistical machine translation rather than grammatical rules, has been severely criticized for accuracy issues, however. More updated versions of Google Translate reported improvements in the level of fluency and accuracy (Turovsky, 2016). Google’s switch to Neural Machine Translation is intended to translate whole sentences rather than brief phrases and is expected to further improve accuracy. What are the implications then for second language teachers and learners? Despite such advancements in translation technology, concerns have also been raised about how the issues of grammatical accuracy in Google Translate could be affecting the learner’s process of building proficiency. (Lovett, D. 2018).

2.2. Applications for second language education that are available right now.

 For language learning, application for younger and older generations have been invented.  Duolingo is a language learning cloud-based online platform that has been very successful for adaptive learning. It uses Automatic Speech Recognition and Natural language processing techniques to teach languages within a networked community. The application has become very well known since it came out and is known for creating a healthy competition between its user. The competition serves as motivation because its users can ''compete'' between friends and other people. The winner is the one who earns the most points by doing exercises that Duolingo has prepared. It also is completely free, compared to other similar applications, such us, Busu. However, it seems as this Al tech tool can serve only as language practice, because the language learner still needs human teachers and social interactions beyond the digital environment to master a language. The work by Crowther (Crowther, et al, 2017) indicate that the “the benefit of Duolingo is more likely as a learning support app than as the sole tool for autonomous learning.”  
 
Fig. 2. Duolingo English tests vs TOEFL and IELTS
Duolingo claims that it can help also with preparing for an important qualification test, such us, TOEFL or IELTS.  As it can be seen in Figure 2., Scatterplots and correlation coefficients showing how Duolingo English Test scores, based on our ML/NLP scale models, relate to other English proficiency measures. (a) Duolingo test score rankings are nearly identical to those of traditional IRT ? estimates fit to real test session data (n = 21,351). (b–c) The scores correlate significantly with other high-stakes English assessments such as TOEFL iBT (n = 2,319) and IELTS (n = 991). 

2.3. Chatbots.

Chatbots are another innovation that can be an amazing tool for learning a new language. As it can be seen in the figure below, the basic mechanism of chatbot begins with the message sent by the user. (Haristiani:2019) As the author writes, the message then is processed by Natural Language Processing, and chatbot responded by replying to the message according to the existing database. For example, when a user sent "how are you?" message, chatbot will look for answers that match this question in the database such as “I am fine”, “Great!” etc.  Fig. 3. Chatbot mechanism

The author has divided the types of chatbots into three types based on its’ structure, purpose, and audience. The sub-categories and their functions is concluded in table 1. (Haristiani:2019)
Table 1 shows that chatbot has several categories and can be developed according to the developer’s necessity. However, chatbots that are developed for educational purposes tend to use artificially intelligence structure. Artificially intelligent chatbot for general purpose such as MILABOT has also been developed.
 
									Table 1. Chatbot types. 

MILABOT is a profound support learning chatbot which is made for chatting with people on mainstream casual discussion topics through both discourse and text. The framework comprises of an ensemble of natural language generation and retrieval models, including template-based models, bag-of-words models, sequence-to-sequence neural network and latent variable neural network models. Chatbots that produced for instructive purposes, particularly for language learning, are portrayed further in the next page.  
Chatbots development to utilize learning and teaching have been conducted. Freudbot has been developed for psychology students to find out about student-content interaction in distance education.
The results show that the basic analysis of the chatlogs indicated a high proportion of on-task behavior. The findings also suggest that chatbot technology may be promising as a teaching and learning tool in distance and online education. Chatbot use is also compared with humanoid robot in science lecture class and reported that the visualization using chatbot was helpful for students to understand the lecture smoothly. However, researches on chatbot use and development to enhance language learning rather difficult to find. This study identified researches on language teaching and learning as seen in table 2.

 
								Table 2. Chatbot research types

Table 2 shows that chatbot researches were for the most part found in English language learning. Examination showed us that the dialogs of a chatbot are generally short on the grounds and that chatbot answers very often are irrelevant and not as lively as when talking to a real human being. However, the results also indicate that many participants are very interested in using chatbot as chatting partner in speaking foreign language, since it is accessible anywhere and anytime, while it is not easy to find native speakers as human chatting partner. The learners also more confident communicating with chatbot which is obviously less intelligent as the human themselves. It would be pedagogically attractive for the learner to chat with a system of artificial intelligence which could “really” understand the natural language and communicatively generate the natural language to form a human-like dialog. (Haristiani:2019)
Further, the main chatbot used in language learning researches as seen in Table 2 is Cleverbot, which developed by British AI scientist Rollo Carpenter in 1986 and went online on 1997. The results of researches of using Cleverbot reported that most students enjoyed using this chatbot. They also generally felt more comfortable conversing with the bots than a student partner or teacher. However, the results also suggest that chatbots are generally only useful for advanced and/or very keen language students. Language teachers also need to get involved and bring chatbot technology into the foreign language learning classroom as a permanent tool for language practice. Research reported that preceding conversation before classroom discussion with a chatbot lead to an increase in the number of contributions that students made to discussion. Moreover, a discussion before with a
chatbot also could increase the students’ awareness of critical thinking and enable them to form inquiring mindsets. However, the result of comparisons in speaking task with chatbot and human partner indicated a significant drop in students' task interest with chatbot, but not human partner. The reason of drop in task interest with chatbot was caused by novelty effect. On the other hand, CSIEC chatbot reported successfully helped students with course unit review, make the students more confident, and improved students’ listening ability, as well as enhanced students’ interest in language learning. The comparison of examination results before and after the using chatbot showed great improvement of students’ performance. (Haristiani:2019)

From above results, it is understood that the use of chatbot gave many advantages in language learning and teaching, as in enhancing classroom motivation and learning. However, chatbot also reported to have flaws comparing to human partner, especially in the novelty aspect. Several researches and chatbot development for English language learning have been conducted, but chatbot development and researches in other languages teaching and learning is still difficult to find. As an attempt to answer this challenge, the author and team tried to develop a chatbot-based multi-language grammar application, namely Gengobot, which will be introduced further in the next paragraph.

Gengobot is a chatbot-based dictionary application about multi-language grammar developed by the
author, using CodeIgniter framework. CI is a PHP framework that can be used to develop PHP based website application without the necessity to write all the code from the beginning. CI framework
was chosen because it is an opensource framework and free to modify, smaller than other framework,
and uses Model-View-Controller concept that functioned in programming process to call
needed databases easily. The main purpose of Gengobot development is to provide a Japanese
grammar learning medium for beginner level of Japanese language learners. However, to broaden its’
use, the application also equipped with grammar contents in English and Indonesian, and integrated
with social media LINE. LINE official account has Messaging API feature that allows an account to
run chatbot that has been created (see figure 2). The database system used in Gengobot is MySQL. MySQL was chosen because it is free licensed, and the database structure used
in MySQL is in table form which is flexible and easy to use. The database created for this chatbot
including: (1) Database of user data storage, including name, language, training score, etc.; (2)
Grammar database in three languages; (2) Questions database and their answer (for ‘Exercise’
feature).
 
					Fig. 2. Gengobot

 The main findings of the research are that chatbots can be categorized into three types and has advantages and disadvantages. As the advantages, chatbot can help language learners through six ways:
 (1) students tend to feel more relaxed talking to a computer than to a person;
 (2) chatbots are willing to repeat the same material with students endlessly;
 (3) many bots provide both text and synthesized speech, allowing students to practice both listening and reading skills; 
(4) Bots are new and interesting to students; 
(5) students have an opportunity to use a variety of language structures and vocabulary that they ordinarily would not have a chance to use;
 (6) chatbots could potentially provide quick and effective feedback for students’ spelling and grammar. (Jaya Kannan1,  Pilar Munday, 2018)
However, they also concluded that although there are many benefits for using chatbots for learning a new language, they also seem to have many flaws and need to be improved. 

2.4. Language learning methodologies and assessment.
Another system of "reinforcement learning" has arisen as the natural side-effect of improved algorithms. As frameworks endeavor to imitate human thinking, they can sort out aspects of language learning (predictive analysis, grammatical rules, frequency of usages) without being educated. Artificial intelligence-based vocabulary advancement frameworks, for example, TextGenome.org are giving language learning openings in which understudies can pick their own way and pace. More and more, learners will be able to take control of their learning. Focus on reinforcement learning has moved AI systems beyond pattern recognition to decision making. Situating language learning using the reinforcement learning framework in real-world contexts can provide language learners with a repertoire of language learning strategies. (Wan, 2017).
 AI essentially utilizes big data from users to build adaptive learning. This has implications for education. Benneman, the head of an organization called EruditeAI, claims that data from users is even more precious than revenue, since the data is helping in the creation of more sophisticated algorithms (Wan, 2017). Large online systems such as Duolingo and MOOCs are collecting huge volumes of student data. An examination of these data is expected to inform student learning in terms of student learning objectives, engagement, and outcomes. The Stanford report mentions the Society for Learning Analytics Research, the Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference, and the Learning at Scale Conference as key organizations studying the complexities of student learning. These large datasets can be used to create meaningful assessment mechanisms, but much depends on how these mechanisms are built.   (Wan, 2017).
2.5. Applications/tools for learning Latvian language. 
After researching online applications and tools for learning Latvian language, it can be said that there are a couple of places that offer Latvian language courses that cost quite a lot of money. If we are taking into consideration only tools that are for free, we can conclude that there are not a lot of materials. There is a room for improvement. 
One website offers some basic introduction to language. (Fig. 3) http://valoda.ailab.lv/latval
 
Fig. 3. Valoda/ailab.lv
In Duolingo, as seen in the figure No. 4, we can find a subsection with some free language lessons. It is not interactive, it just contains text. https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/10300625.

On YouTube there are also a couple of videos that learn basic phrases in Latvian. (See Fig. 5.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cUvaa8lY5Q

2.6 Intelligent Tutor

The Intelligent Tutor bases its capacity to analyze some student mistakes and right them on the recurrence, gravity and communicational hugeness of the mistakes found in a student corpus, considering the objective students' presentation to the structures being referred to just as the students' particular necessities. 
It very well may be said that this program includes a crossover improvement approach. This requires the clarification of the two most continuous ways to deal with educational parser improvement. While various parser-based guides can oblige a scope of unsurprising mistakes, in view of the engineers' hunches (Holland et al., 1993; Matthews, 1993) as opposed to on orderly examination, another methodology utilizes mistake labeled student corpora as a standard framework component (Granger, 2003; L'Haire and Faltin, 2003). The Intelligent Tutor examined here has been created utilizing a student corpus, however the corpus itself isn't a piece of the framework.

3 THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS
3.1. Research methodology

The main research method of this paper is survey research and its main purpose is ‘to produce statistics, that is, quantitative and numerical descriptions about some aspects of the study population.’ (Floyd J., 2009:1) The author of the book Survey research methods also mentions that in surveys the information is collected about only ‘a fraction of the population, that is, a sample rather than from every member of population.’ (Floyd J., 2009:1) As the main task of this research is to find out about the use of Artificial Intelligence for language learning purposes, surveys are going to give an overview and information about that. 
 In this research, mostly quantitative research approach is used, because the main objective of the quantitative approach is ‘to quantify data and generalize results from a sample to the population of interest’ (Monfared, 2015:1113). The main goal of this research is to determine whether or not foreigners would be more willing to learn Latvian if there would be appropriate Artificial intelligence tools for learning Latvian language. In carrying out the present research, several research procedures were applied:
1.	identifying research goal, research questions and enabling objectives; 
2.	selecting a corpus; 
3.	studying context;
4.	doing analysis of the surveys.

3.2. Findings

A survey was developed and given out to foreigners and people that live in Latvia but do not speak Latvian. All together there were 32 respondents who did not speak Latvian. Some of the respondents understand some phrases. The main goal of the survey is to understand the reasons why those foreigners have not learned Latvian yet and whether Al tools could potentially help with learning Latvian. 
After gathering the surveys, we can conclude that Latvian language is challenging for foreigners.  From the 32 respondents that do not speak Latvian, 1/3 have been living in Latvia for more than 1 year and 1/3 for more than 10 years. (Chart 1) 

 
Chart 1. Have long have you been living in Latvia?


To the question what the main reasons are why they have not learned Latvian, the most popular answers are:
•	that there is no time to learn – 12 respondents
•	Latvian is too difficult – 6 respondents
•	they feel embarrassed when practicing/talking in Latvian – 6 respondents
•	do not want to go to language courses – 3 respondents
•	other – 3 respondents

After seeing that there are so many respondents that do not have time to learn language or don’t have time to attend Latvian language courses or feel embarrassed to talk in Latvian, it was interesting to see how many would be interested to learn language if they could do it at their own time with Artificial Intelligence tools. 
To the question whether respondents have used Artificial Intelligence tool for learning any other languages, almost 90 % of respondents answered that they have. (Chart 2)

 
Chart 2. Have you used Artificial Intelligence tool for learning any other languages?

In addition to that, as it can be seen in chart 3. - 94% of respondents said that they found Artificial Intelligence tools useful and helpful when learning a new language. 

 
Chart 3. Did you find it helpful to use Al for language learning?

To the question of what kind of tools respondents have used in the past for language learning and found them helpful:  

•	almost 50 % of respondents have used machine translation,
•	29% have used language learning applications
•	more than 13 % have used chatbots 
•	3 % have used personalized textbooks
•	2% replied that they have used other Artificial tools

One of the questions was specifically meant for those who have used chatbots because chatbots seem to be very helpful when people want to practice their newly developed language skills but are too embarrassed or don’t have an opportunity to practice it with a real human being.  In the chart 4 we can see reasons why people found chatbots very helpful and the most common answer was that they are too shy to say something wrong to a real human, so they feel more relaxed when talking to a ‘robot’.  

Respondents also answered that chatbots are willing to repeat themselves as much as needed, whereas when talking to a real human being, people tend to feel embarrassed when they do not understand something after asking to repeat it two times. Some of the respondents mentioned as one of the benefits that chatbots are new and interesting as compared to the standard teaching methods and in addition, chatbots always use grammatically correct sentence structures and speech. 

To the last question of whether or not they would be willing to learn Latvian language if there would be developed language applications and/or chatbots that speak in Latvian, surprisingly, 30 respondents out of 32 responded with a yes. This shows us that if we would develop more applications and/or chatbots specifically for Latvian language, more people would learn it and potentially stay in Latvia.  

CONCLUSIONS

We can conclude that nowadays knowing a second language is not only considered as norm but also as a necessity in order to be successful in the job market. Learning a new language is challenging and time consuming, bet with appropriate tools people can dictate their own learning speed and make the learning process interesting.
	As the technologies are developing so fast, teaching methods have also changed in regard to language teaching. Gone are the times when students studied only textbooks when learning new languages. Now there are so many different language applications, interactive videos, software tools, chatbots, machine translation and many more. 
	Unfortunately, there is not so much information regarding learning Latvian language. A lot of Latvian language courses are offered by language academies, but what about those that do not want to go to language courses, does not have time for that or does not live in Latvia? The courses cost quite a lot of money and not everyone can afford to go to such courses. There are very little interactive videos online, applications ext., Even if someone does decide to study Latvian, it is very unlikely that he/she would be able to do it with the information online. 
	After analyzing the response from people that do not speak Latvian. We can conclude that one of the reasons why they still have not learned Latvian is that there is not enough tools online in order to learn Latvian language. Such tools as, Chatbots, personalized textbooks, interactive videos would be a huge help to foreigners because most of them feel embarrassed or don’t have a chance to practice their newly learned skills with a real human being. There are many benefits for using chatbots. 
	To the question of whether respondents would like to learn Latvian if sufficient tools would be provided – 30 respondents out of 32 respondents with a Yes. That just shows us that we should try to develop enough tools so that more people would like to learn Latvian and potentially live here and be a valuable part of our society.
