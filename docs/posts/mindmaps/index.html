<p>Mind maps have a very long history that goes as far back as the 3d century. They have been proven to be very effective tool not only for studying but also for innovation and creativity.  Thus, the main goal of this research was to find out how many students of the University of Latvia use mind maps and afterwards compere the use of mind map frequency between full-time and part-time students, especially in home reading assignments.  The literature review and surveys were used as the main research methods.  The results revealed that full-time students are much more familiar with mind maps and therefore use them more frequently than part-time students. The most common reasons for using them was that they help to structure ideas, remember information and understand a text.  Part-time students were not as open to try mind maps as full-time students and had their own ways how to study.
Key words: mind maps, reading assignments, full-time students, part-time students, surveys</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Mind maps have become an important part not only in academic discourse, but also in non-academic areas and there is no wonder why so many researchers are interested in this topic. Although mind maps have variety names – semantic maps, think-links, concept maps, cognitive maps, and concept maps - generally speaking, they are a tool that can be used in many areas – work, school, inventions- and can help with speeding up the learning process, developing new ideas, understanding a new, complicated system, or even when learning a new language.
Many studies have been done about mind mapping and its effectiveness in different areas. “Mind mapping’’ as a term was first used by Tony Buzan who described it as a process where the learner “places supra-ordinate concepts on paper and subsequently links subordinate concepts as appropriate” (1993:59). He also compares a Mind map to a map of a city where the center of the city is the center of the mind map. A city map has the same advantages as mind maps, because they can help with:
understanding structures better and give an overview of a large area
gathering data together
understanding which roads has one been to and what was the result
seeing a picture from different perspectives. (Buzan, 2005:23)
Another author mentions that “mind maps are an excellent way to help learners organize knowledge, to empower themselves to better comprehend the key concepts, and principles in lectures, readings, or other instructional materials” (McGriff, 2000:9).
Buzan also claims that’ Mind Maps help you to learn, organize, and store as much information as needed, and to classify it in natural ways that give an easy and instant access (perfect memory) to whatever.’ (1993:59)
Many studies done about mind mapping’s effectiveness has shown benefits. For instance, it can help with boosting ones memory. A study conducted by Farrand, Hussain and Hennessey (2002) showed that mind mapping improved participant long</p>
<p>term memory of factual information by 10%. It can also foster the creativity and help with generating new ideas. A study by Al-Jarf (2009) proves that Mind Mapping software can help people to generate new ideas faster, encourages creativity and visualization.  A couple of studies have been done about using mind mapping for enhancing reading comprehension and almost all the studies show that mind mapping helps to better understand the texts and remember information. (Study conducted at CHIJ Our Lady of the Nativity School:2007)
Reading itself is a very complicated subject and has been studied from different perspectives over many centuries. Clarke (1980: 35) calls reading &lsquo;the most thoroughly studied and least understood process in education today&rsquo;. Reading is an interaction between the reader and the text. Ability to read is very important not only in academic areas, but also in the day to day life in order to survive in this world. Unfortunately, not always reading a text leads to understanding it. ‘Comprehension is a highly complex cognitive process involving the intentional interaction between the reader and the text to meaning’ (Online 4)
The many studies done on mind mapping show that there are many advantages for using them in reading assignments. Studies prove that they improve comprehension of the text and also help to better remember the information read. (Ardakani, Lasharian: 2015) There is no doubt that mind mapping is a useful tool when doing reading assignments and that is why the goal of this research is to determine how often do full-time and part-time students use mind mapping for individual reading assignments at the University of Latvia and what are the performance results.
In this research the following research questions were addressed:
Do full-time students or part-time students use mind maps more frequently?
Do students use them for reading assignments?
What are the reasons for using/not using them?
What are the performance results of using mind maps for reading assignments?
In order to determine how often students do use mind mapping for individual reading assignments, the following enabling objectives are set:</p>
<ol>
<li>To read and analyze the theory available on the mind mapping;</li>
<li>To analyze the questionnaires;</li>
<li>To draw relevant conclusions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this research, literature review and surveys are used as research methods.
Tony Buzan (1990) The Mind Map Book is used as the main theoretical framework. Visidati.lv was used in order to make surveys and get information about the use of mind mapping at the University of Latvia.</p>
<p>1 THEORITICAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Chapter 1 deals with literature review and theory about mind mapping and its history.</p>
<p>History of mind mapping goes as far back as the 3rd century. The first traces of mind mapping come from the philosopher Porphyry of Tyros. (Online 1) He is believed to be the first to use mind mapping in order to form his ideas and therefore make the learning process easier for the others. Some researchers have found that the famous Leonardo Da Vinci has been practicing mind mapping too, mostly for note taking. The history shows that many other great geniuses have been using the power of vision to generate new ideas, such us, Galileo Galilei, Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, Michelangelo and many others. (Buzan, 2005)
Although researchers have found many traces of mind mapping throughout history, network semantics was developed late 1950s. (Online 1) The theory was very basic and simple and later in the 1960s was continued by Quillian and Dr. Collins. Dr. Collins was believed to be the Father of modern mind mapping, because he was the one who used the concept of network semantics where all the ideas and thoughts are linked to each other. Later in 1960s, Tony Buzan, a British psychologist, took the lead and continued to popularize, shape the rules for mind mapping, wrote many books on mind mapping, gave instructions and even rules how to use mind mapping for various purposes. (Online 1)
Nowadays almost everyone knows the basic rules for mind mapping. There are even mind mapping applications and web cloud based mind mapping tools that are easy to use. Tony Buzan believes that mind maps help to organize a text or thoughts and that there are no limits for information that the brain can store. Mind mapping can help to store as much information as needed, because every new knowledge the brain gets, it ‘hooks on‘ to already existing information in there. (Buzan, 2005)
Buzan explains that psychology of learning and remembering what is learned is a very complicated process. Each brain has approximately one million brain cells, but no human that has ever existed can use all the potential of his brain and that is why Buzan does not ever estimate the limits of a brain, because such limits do not exist. (1993:31) He also does not support the theory that was developed in the late 1960s, when Professor Roger Sperry of California developed a theory ‘’The Cerebral cortex’’. These findings basically indicated that there are two sides of a brain. Sperry’s findings showed that the right side of the brain was responsible for ‘rhythm, spatial awareness, wholeness, imagination, daydreaming, color and dimension’ but the left side for ‘words, logic, numbers, sequence, linearity, analysis and lists.’ (Buzan, 1993:31). It is believed that for some people the right side is more dominant than the left side, but Buzan does not believe in labelling people like that. He thinks that all people have the protentional to develop even the ‘’weaker’’ side of the brain. ‘The only barrier to the expression and application of all our mental skills is our knowledge of how to access them’. (Buzan, 1993:33)
The many studies done on the brain and the memory show that the human brain primarily memorizes the information given in the beginning of the lecture or study period. People also tend to remember any information that is highlighted as very important or unique, items that for the student are very interesting and exciting and items that are somehow linked or already stored in the brain. (Buzan, 1993:34). All these findings helped to develop the Mind Mapping and showed why it is important and more efficient to use mind mapping than, for instance, note making/taking.</p>
<p>2 NOTE MAKING/TAKING VS MIND MAPPING</p>
<p>Chapter 2 compares note making/taking with mind mapping and discusses pros and cons.
The most common way for students to learn is note taking/making, but the theory of the right and the left hemisphere explains why it is not effective. Firstly, Buzan claims that there is a clear distinction between note making and note taking. Note making is usually ‘organizing own thoughts, often in a creative, innovative way’ but the note taking is ‘summarizing someone else’s thoughts, as expressed in a book, article or lecture’(Buzan, 1993:43).
The standard note making/taking is not effective because the notes are usually taken only in straight lines, standard symbols are used, such us, numbers, words, letters and analysis. This means that only the left hemisphere is used which’s functions are mainly analysis, symbols and lineal patterning, but the right hemisphere’s functions, such as, imagination, visualization, spatial awareness, color, association, creativity, art awareness are completely absent.
This just shows the reason why note taking/making is associated with the word ‘’monotone’’. Students usually use just blue or black color pen, writes down the words in a straight line and there is no wonder why they remember so little from the lectures. The brain is bored and when it is bored is just ‘’shuts down’’. The hand might be moving and writing down the information, but it does not mean that the brain is fully conscious and open to take in the information. It is crucial for students to use all the tools available in the learning process so that it would be as effective as possible. With all these missing elements, the brain will not work to its full potential and therefor students may get discouraged and bored with the learning process. If note taking process only activates one side of the brain, the other side of the brain is sleeping. This just means that we are using even less than half of our cerebral cortex. (Buzan, 1993:49)
Nowadays there are many tactics and ways for note taking but the most common one is the lineal note taking system.  According to Buzan, there are many disadvantages of a standard notes:
They overshadow the key words. In standard notes key words are usually scattered on different pages and between the key words are many unnecessary and unimportant words that distract the brain from the important ones.</p>
<p>It is difficult to remember information from the notes. The text is so similar looking, monotonous and boring that the it ‘puts the brain in a semi-hypnotic trance, making it almost impossible to remember their content.’ (Buzan, 1993:49)
They waste time, because of the unhelpful writing, useless reading of the long notes and time-consuming search for the key words.</p>
<p>They do not encourage to think creatively. Creativity would help the brain to make associations and therefore make it easier to remember new information. (ibid:50).
Unfortunately, these inefficient note taking systems leave many students very demotivated and sometimes even given up for education. Standard note taking systems which are learned since very young age have consequences. For some students that have more dominant the creative side of the brain, the learning and memorizing process may become so difficult that he/she gets discouraged and starts to feel hateful towards education or any kind of learning process.</p>
<p>3 MIND MAPS IN READING ASSIGNEMENTS</p>
<p>Chapter 3 deals with mind maps in reading assignments and summarizes the results of many studies done about mind map use for reading assignments.</p>
<p>Reading is a very complicated process and has been studied for many years. Without reading, it is almost impossible to study at a school, college or university. The ability to read is crucial for any student because so many home tasks and self-study is done at home. Unfortunately, very often the ability to read is not enough. Many students that read texts in a foreign language do not have a complete comprehension of the text.
As this research focuses on using mind maps in reading assignments, it was important to find out the advantages and disadvantages for using them in reading. There are already a couple of studies done about the results of using mind maps for reading and reading comprehension. For example, one study done used mind maps in order to improve reading comprehension ability of Thai EFl University students. Students in Thailand were given texts and tasks in English and the results showed that almost all students got higher score in tests after using mind maps. (Siriphanich, 2010)
Another study ‘’Reading with understanding through the use of mind maps’’ that was done to test if mind maps help to improve the reading comprehension for seven years old pupils showed that many pupils got a better understanding of the texts. The teachers claimed that most of the seven-year-old children were ‘showing signs of improvement in their ability to answer comprehension questions.’ (Online 2).
Study done in 2007 got similar results after testing ten-year-old pupils. The goal of the research was to understand if mind maps help pupils to better remember text passages, understand them and enhance pupils to develop general thinking skills.  The results revealed that pupils showed better understanding of the text and text passages, they also better remembered information form the texts and showed more interest in the classroom when teachers were asking questions. (Online 2)
Many studies show that mind maps not only help with reading comprehension but also with memorizing texts. For instance, a study done in 2009 researched from 9 to 12 year old children. They separated children in 2 groups. One group was asked to remember a list of 30 words, but the other group the same words but organized in a Mind Map format. The results revealed that Mind map group children had improvement in memory of up to 30 %. This just shows us how effective mind maps are. (Online 2)</p>
<p>4 USE OF MINDS MAPS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF                              LATVIA</p>
<p>Chapter 4 explains the research methodology and summarizes the results.</p>
<p>4.1. Research methodology</p>
<p>The main research method of this paper is survey research and its main purpose is ‘to produce statistics, that is, quantitative and numerical descriptions about some aspects of the study population.’ (Floyd J., 2009:1) The author of the book Survey research methods also mentions that in surveys the information is collected about only ‘a fraction of the population, that is, a sample rather than from every member of population.’ (Floyd J., 2009:1) As the main task of this research is to find out about the use of mind maps between part-time and full-time students, surveys are going to give an overview and information about that.
In this research, mostly quantitative research approach is used, because the main goal of this research is to determine how often full-time and part-time students use mind mapping for individual reading assignments at the University of Latvia and what are the performance results. The main objective of the quantitative approach is ‘to quantify data and generalize results from a sample to the population of interest’ (Monfared, 2015:1113). In carrying out the present research, several research procedures were applied:
identifying research goal, research questions and enabling objectives;
selecting a corpus;
studying context;
doing analysis of the surveys.</p>
<p>4.2. Findings</p>
<p>In order to find out how many students use mind maps while studying for reading assignments and whether part-time or full-time students use mind maps more frequently, the surveys were used. The survey consists of 10 questions from which 9 are closed-ended questions, but 1 is an open-ended question.
The surveys were given to full-time students from the faculty of Business, Management and Economics and to part-time students from faculty of Humanities. Firstly, the task was to find out whether all the students know what are mind maps and the basic principles for using them.
Figure 5.1 Have you heard of mind mapping – full time students</p>
<p>The results show in the table 5.1 that 96% of full-time students do know what are mind maps, 3 % have heard about them, but do not remember the basic principles. Different statistics were for part-time students (table 5.2), because only half of the respondents recognized them, and 16 % did not know about them at all.</p>
<p>Figure 5.2 Have you heard of mind mapping – part time students
Secondly, four pictures were showed to students and the task was to tell which one is a mind map. 75 % of full-time students answered correctly but 25 % chose spider gram as the answer. Although spider grams are similar to mind maps, they are a few differences, because spider maps usually have a central image, hierarchical structure, a lot of phrases, sentences and no color, whereas mind maps focuses more on key words, colors, curved lines, branches and sub-branches. (Online 3) All the part-time students chose the correct answer, but to the question if they know the basic principles of practicing mind maps, 83% answered that they are not sure and only 13% said that they know. Full-time students are more familiar with mind maps because almost 60% of students know the basic principles of mind maps, and only 6,3% do not.
As the main goal of this research is to find out if students use minds maps, specifically for home reading assignments, the respondents were asked how often they have home reading assignments. 65% of full time students responded that they have home reading tasks once a month, but 89% of part time students have them 3-5 times a month which is logical, considering the fact that part time students have lectures only on Saturdays and most of the studying has to be done independently.
After finding out how often students do have home reading tasks, the next step was to understand if respondents have tried mind maps when doing the home assignments. The results in the table 2.3 show that 66% of full-time students have used mind maps and 34% have not.   Different results are between part-time students because only 14% have tried mind maps.</p>
<p>Figure 2.3 Have you practiced mind mapping in home reading assignment – full time</p>
<p>The reasons for using mind maps between full-time students differ:
40 % use them because they help to better remember the information
25% use them because they help to better understand the text
32.5 % do not use them at all
prefer to use them because they help to see the main idea of the text and not get lost.</p>
<p>The part-time student results are different, because 57% do not use mind maps at all, 14% think that they help to understand the text better and 14% use them because they help remember the information.
Figure 5.4. How often do you use mind maps – full time students.</p>
<p>Full time students from the faculty of Business, Management and Economics use mind maps quite frequently. Almost 46% use them once a week, 24% use them once a semester and 12% almost never, except when it is mandatary. Most of the part time students (57%) never use mind maps, but 28% use them rarely, once a year.<br>
The results were expected to be different, taking into the consideration that part-time students read and study on their own more than 90% of the time and mind maps could help to better understand and remember the information. The results in the figure 5.4. show that it is completely opposite because full-time students use mind maps much more often than part-time students. This could be due to the fact that most of the part-time students have not been introduced to mind maps properly and therefore it may take more time in the beginning to get used to practicing them. At first it may seem that creating them takes more time and it will not be worth the effort, but according to many studies done, it is quite the opposite.
To the open question about what are the benefits of using mind maps, the answers differed. Many students gave a positive feedback, but also some were negative. For instance, the most common benefits mentioned was that mind maps are effective because they help to organize thoughts, help to understand the main idea and facts, remember details, take in information, help to concentrate more on the important tasks, help to remember and help to structure only the important key words.
However, respondents who prefer not to use mind maps mentioned as the reason that they include only smart part of the text and therefore a lot of important information may get lost. Other respondents prefer and think that it is more effective to take notes or that mind maps are waste of time and take too long time to create. A lot of part-time students mentioned that they have their own ways to remember information or a way to structure a text.
Knowing now that full-time students use and know the benefits of mind maps, it was also important to find out if respondents who have not tried mind maps, would be willing to give a chance to them and the results were positive. Almost 70 % of all respondents answered – yes. This means that students are open to try new approaches.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>This research has explained what are mind maps and what are benefits for using them while studying for a test, reading assignments or anything school related. The many studies done about mind maps has shown many advantages and has proved that they are very effective. Not only they help to better remember information, but also, they improve reading comprehension and creativeness for essays, reports or work related tasks.
Returning to the goal of this research posed at the beginning, it is now possible to state that full-time students use mind maps much more frequently than part-time students. Almost 48% of part time students use mind maps at least once a week, whereas 28% of part time students use them only once a year.
Although part-time students have reading tasks and individual studying at home much more often, they almost never chose to use mind maps. This is due to the fact that part-time students have not been properly introduced to mind maps and all their benefits. Whereas full time students have claimed that teachers talk about mind maps a lot and sometimes even suggest to do some tasks while using them.  Full-time students have a very positive feedback about using mind maps. They help to structure the text and help with memorizing information.
The most important limitation lies in the fact that students surveyed were from different faculties. Part time students were from the Faculty of Humanities, but the full-time from the Faculty of Economics and Management.  The results could have been more accurate if students from the same faculty would have been surveyed. There is a possibility that, for instance, students from the Faculty of Humanities have to do more reading at home than students from the Faculty of Economics. Another difference could be because of the lecturers. Some teachers prefer mind maps, some do not and therefore students get influenced by their lecturers.
Further research might explore mind map use between specific courses, for example, comparison between the use of mind maps in management course and creative writing course. Mind map use could be also explored in different universities and all the reasons why it is more common for university X to use them, but not for the university Y.</p>
<p>THESES</p>
<ol>
<li>In a basic sense, mind maps are diagrams that are usually made around a single concept which is usually in the center of a page and then other key words and ideas are associated and connected to it.</li>
<li>Mind maps have a very long history and has been used by many great people, such as, Leonardo Da Vinci, Alileo Galilei, Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, Michelangelo and many others.</li>
<li>Many studies done about mind maps show that they are very effective and help to better remember information from reading assignments, help with reading comprehension and even creativity and new idea generation.</li>
<li>Note taking system is very inefficient because only one side of the brain is used.  The text is very similar looking, monotone with only straight lines which can make the brain go into a semi-hypnotic trance.</li>
<li>In general, full-time students are much more familiar with mind maps – how to use them and what are the benefits.</li>
<li>Mind maps are much more frequently used by full-time students than part-time.</li>
<li>The most common reasons for using mind maps of the University of Latvia students are that they help to structure ideas, remember information and see the main idea of a long texts.</li>
